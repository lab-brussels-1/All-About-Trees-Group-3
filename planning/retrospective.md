# Retrospective

This project ask us to work in team, learn how to collaborate and organizing
project steps, helping each other.

## Stop Doing

- Stopped trying to add too much of our own stuff to the code

## Continue Doing

- Short emergency meetings on top of our regular meetings.

- Checking our team work progress.

## Start Doing

- Extra styling and possibly even a page

- Checking before committing to master

## Lessons Learned

- Check if you pull before pushing from new branch

- Just practice and ask help if you stacked

- Each member of the group can share experience with conflicts that exactly can
  help to whole team.

## Strategy vs. Board

- Our team created md files in planning folders, which is very helpful to follow
  the project.

- We have created issues for every md file and html and CSS files that related
  to Project and Deliverable with related labels and milestones.

- We followed all steps of issues in Project Board, so we can see project
  progress.
