based on how long you've been stuck on the same problem:

1. _0 -> 30 min_: Try on your own
2. _30 -> 60 min_: Ask your group for help
3. _60+ min_: Tag your coaches in Slack or GitHub

- An issue to discuss your group's schedule and communications plan, this can be
  linked to PRs that contribute to the.
- Everyone is available after 6:00PM
