  External constraints coming from the outside are thrust upon a company.  Our team has no (or little) control over the constraint.  We must build their product and systems around that constraint.  They must learn to live with it.
  - project deadlines
  - Design and idea of this product
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
