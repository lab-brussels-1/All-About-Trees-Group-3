## External

- Time line for the project is one week (due to rebuilding of existing project)
- Github

<!--
  External constraints coming from the outside are thrust upon a company.  Our team has no (or little) control over the constraint.  We must build their product and systems around that constraint.  They must learn to live with it.
  - project deadlines
  - Design and idea of this product
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)

      Constraints that we  decided to help finish our project. They may include:
      - Share ideas and scope of work
      - planning all steps for coding review
      - the number of hours we want to spend working
      - and discussing over project step by step
      - now we have Google meeting twice a day for detailed working
